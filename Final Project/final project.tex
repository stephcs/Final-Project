\section{Introduction}

Quick summary: We are getting chased by a raptor and are about to get eaten. We are trying to figure out if even with a a head start would we still be raptor food.

for i in range$(len(x)):\\$
 $  h = 30 + (3*i)\\$
    $r = 18*i\\$
    if $r==h:\\$
        print $ h,r,i\\$
This coding helps figure out at exactly what meter the raptor catches up to us and how much time has elapsed through the help of loops.\\
'i' is equal to the time in this case and the if statement helps find when both distances are equal to each other.\\
After calculating, it is easy to see, especially after graphing, that the raptor catches up to us with ease, even after our 30 meter head start.\\

The raptor caught up to us after 2 seconds at 36 meters.\\

first = float(1)/5\\
second = float(15)/100\\
third = float(7)/100\\
probability = first*second*third\\
print probability\\
0.0021\\
After some more coding, it is easy to figure out the percentage of how probable it would be to get away. Looking at that number, we have a very slight chance of making it away alive.
